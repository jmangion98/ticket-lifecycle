<p>
Karen (End User) is creating a ticket by filling out the required fields for the support center. She selects the Help Topic Reporting a Problem and provides a brief summary stating that the entire mobile/online banking system is down. After completing these details, Karen adds a concise yet thorough description of the issue affecting her employees.

<p>Next, John, a Help Desk Agent, logs into his account to review the ticket details. Agents can access active tickets in the Agent panel. Managers can assign high-priority tickets to the appropriate agents and apply Service Level Agreements (SLAs).</p>

<p>After John selects the ticket, he accesses relevant information, including the SLA, status, and priority. Lacking permission to modify it, he reassigns the ticket to Help Desk Agent Jane. She assigns the SLA plan Sev-A (Severity 1), indicating a critical issue that requires an initial response within 1 hour, updates every 4 hours, and resolution or downgrade within 24 hours.</p>

<p>As Jane works on resolving the issue, she posts an update to inform everyone of her assessment and the steps she is taking to address it.

<p>Jane's initial assessment of the issue turned out to be correct. During the process of resolving it, she escalated the ticket's priority to 'Emergency,' as the problem had the potential to impact the entire business</p>
